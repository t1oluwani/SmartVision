# SmartVision

‚ö†Ô∏èüö® **Important Notice** üö®‚ö†Ô∏è  

The free tier of most deployment services lack sufficient memory to be able to train new models or perform predictions with complex models such as FNNs or CNNs. Predictions are limited to the simple and cost-effective  **logistic regression model**. While all the pretrained models store pretrained parameters, loading the FNNs and CNNs model are too resource-intensive and computationally expensive for the current deployment setup. Attempting to clear these models and train your own will likely fail on the deployed site due to these limitations. To train or test your own models, you will need to clone the project and deploy it locally. Detailed instructions for this process can be found in the **Installation** section. 

Additionally the object recognition aspect has yet to be implemented by me yet. Thank you for your understanding! 

## Overview

Welcome to **SmartVision**, a cutting-edge visual recognition playground! This platform lets you explore and interact with advanced visual recognition models for handwritten numbers and object recognition *(incomplete)* The main features include:

- An interactive canvas where users can draw handwritten numbers and click a button to receive predictions generated by various trained models, each offering its own output.
- A feature that enables users to explore different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), helping them understand their use cases and capabilities.
- **(NOT IMPLEMENTED)** An option to upload an image for object recognition, classifying the objects into categories based on the FashionMNIST dataset. 

# Deployment

Deployed backend on a web service on render and frontend on a static site on render.<br><br>
Live deployment can be accessed to explore SmartVision here:<br><br>

## Installation

To get started with SmartVision, follow these steps:

1. Clone or fork the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/t1oluwani/SmartVision.git
   ```
   
2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment** (Optional, but Highly Recommended):
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd SmartVision
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment using `venv`:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On **Windows**:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **macOS/Linux**:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
       
3. Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. After installing the backend dependencies, navigate back to the root folder:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

5. In `frontend/services/MLModelClient.js`, comment out **Line 4** and uncomment **Line 3**. Should look like this:
   ```
   const API_URL = "http://localhost:5000"; // Local Backend URL
   // const API_URL = "https://smartvisionbackend.onrender.com"; // Deployed Backend URL
   ```

6. Start the backend server and frontend by running the following shell script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. **Toggle Between Models**
   - Select a model (Logistic Regression, CNN, or FNN) to compare their performance and results.
   - Each model's accuracy and processing details are displayed to help you understand their strengths and limitatio

2. **Handwriting Recognition**
   - Draw a handwritten number (0-9) directly on the provided canvas.
   - Click "Identify" to send your image to the backend.
   - The app processes the image and predicts the number class using your selected model (Logistic Regression, CNN, or FNN).

3. **Object Recognition** (INCOMPLETE)
   - Upload an image to classify objects into categories based on the **FashionMNIST** dataset.
   - The application uses trained models to identify and predict the object class. 

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vue.js.  
- **Backend**: Flask.
- **APIs**: Canvas API for drawing.
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch and Torchvision.  
  - Models: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).  
  - Datasets: MNIST for handwritten numbers, FashionMNIST for object recognition.

## API Documentation

API documentation will be available at: [https://github.com/t1oluwani/SmartVision/blob/main/APIdocs.md]

The API includes:
- **POST /train/<model_type>**: Train and save the selected model (CNN, FNN, Logistic Regression).
- **POST /predict/<model_type>**: Upload an image for classification using the selected model.
- **GET /clear/<model_type>**: Delete the saved model of the specified type (CNN, FNN, Logistic Regression).
- **GET /**: Test the server to ensure it is running.

## Testing

To ensure the backend is functioning correctly, you can run the provided test files:
```bash
python api_tests/<test_file>
```
