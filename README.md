# SmartVision

## Overview

Welcome to **SmartVision**, a cutting-edge visual recognition playground! This platform lets you explore and interact with advanced visual recognition models for handwritten numbers.<!-- and object recognition. --> The main features include:

- Interactive Handwriting Recognition: Draw handwritten numbers directly on a canvas and click a button to see predictions generated by different trained models, each providing its own output.
<!-- - Object Recognition: Upload an image to classify objects into categories based on the FashionMNIST dataset.   -->
- Model Exploration: Learn about Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and understand their use cases and capabilities.  

## Deployment

## Usage

SmartVision is easy to use and requires no additional setup for configuration or API keys. Here's how you can explore its functionalities:

1. **Handwriting Recognition**
   - Draw a handwritten number (0-9) directly on the provided canvas.
   - Click "Identify" to send your image to the backend.
   - The app processes the image and predicts the number class using your selected model (Logistic Regression, CNN, or FNN).

<!-- 2. **Object Recognition**
   - Upload an image to classify objects into categories based on the **FashionMNIST** dataset.
   - The application uses trained models to identify and predict the object class. -->

3. **Toggle Between Models**
   - Select a model (Logistic Regression, CNN, or FNN) to compare their performance and results.
   - Each model's accuracy and processing details are displayed to help you understand their strengths and limitatio

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Canvas API for drawing.  
- **Backend**: Flask.  
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch and Torchvision.  
  - Models: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).  
  - Datasets: MNIST for handwritten numbers, FashionMNIST for object recognition.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints are structured to handle:
- **Handwriting Recognition**: Accepts image data from the canvas and returns the predicted number class.  
- **Object Recognition**: Processes uploaded images and predicts their object categories.

Detailed API implementation is available in the file [api.py](#).

## Testing

To ensure the backend is functioning correctly, you can run the provided test files:
```bash
python api_tests/<test_file>
```
